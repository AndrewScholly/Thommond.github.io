      <h2>Hobbies</h2>

      <p>I have quite a bit of hobbies but if I had to tone it down to
      three I would choose Cycling, non-fiction reading and the great out
      doors.</p>

       <h3>Cycling</h3>

       <p>I am a big fan of taking a break during the week to go on
       a long brisk bike ride. I like the workout and that feeling of
       accoplishment at the end of the ride. Most importantly no matter
       how busy my life or my fellow riders lives are we still make it
       to our weekly rides. It brings us together! </p>

       <h3>Non-Fiction Reading</h3>

       <p>I due enjoy lots of generas of books but my favorite by far
       is Non-fiction. I enjoy non-fiction reading the most due to the
       satifaction I get from learing and using something new. Non-
       fiction lets the reader carry the facts however they please,me
       personally I make a story about the information instead of the
       author doing it for me!</p>

   <h3>The Great Outdoors</h3>

   <p>There is so much to love about nature but to keep this small I
   will be brief. When I feel stressed or just want some leisure time
   I will get outside. Ever since I was a small boy the sight of trees
   or the sound of the animals would give me joy. After all who doesnt
   love nature?</p>
