                     <h3>The N.A.P</h3>

                     <p>The N.A.P stands for the Non-aggression pact. This means
                     it is an agreed upon law which states anyone who shows aggression
                     in the form of violence is violating the law. Not just getting an
                     gry, its more than that. N.A.P. violations include assualt, harra
                     ssment,rape,theft, violation of contract, murder and etc. As you
                     can see its not as simple as it my sound. More on the N.A.P at
