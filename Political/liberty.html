      <h2>Lets start with polices</h2>

      <hr>

      <h3>The N.A.P</h3>

      <p>The N.A.P stands for the Non-aggression pact. This means
        it is an agreed upon law which states anyone who shows aggression
        in the form of violence is violating the law. Not just getting an
        gry, its more than that. N.A.P. violations include assualt, harra
        ssment,rape,theft, violation of contract, murder and etc. As you
        can see its not as simple as it my sound. More on the N.A.P at
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

      <h3>Gun policy</h3>

      <p>Libertarian gun policy is actual quite simple. We support the
        right to own, and use your firearm and other weapons if needed.
        Moreover, Libertarians dont support any weapons ban including
        weapons attachments and much more. Its your right what autho
        rity to we have to stop you?</p>

      <h3>Drug policy</h3>

      <p>Libertarian drug policy is a bit more complicated. We support the
        decrimilization of all drugs and the legalization of cannabis and
        pychoactive mushrooms. We support changing the goal from punishment
        to rehabilitation with non-criminal drug offenders.</p>

      <h3>Healthcare Policy</h3>

      <p>Many libertarians support the complete aboshiment of government
        healthcare, although I agree in long term measures I would like to
        prepose a 5 year plan to abolish the federal healthcare system. what
        would replace it? The free market will allow for cheap alternatives.</p>

      <h3>Taxes and fees</h3>

      <p>Libertarian taxation polices are much more leinyent then our
        counter parts. We prepose taxes as low as 14% flate rate. Why flat
        rate? Rich tax payers dont pay 90% of their taxes due to cheap avenues
        of excape. With a flat rate it would not be worth their time avoidind
        the tax. I personally support the abolshment of the property,sales,
        and lexuries taxes.</p>

      <h3>Foriegn policy</h3>

      <p>Libertarian foriegn policy is straight to the point. Libertatians
        understand the importance of a strong military, but we are isolation
        ists. Military should only be for defence and needed conflict. At the
        current military state libertarians would highly decrease our footprint
        in foriegn wars, and astablish bases only in defensive positions. The
        seeking of wars will stop. Moreover, other foriegn policy includes the
        complete defunding of foriegn aid in a 3 year period.</p>

      <h3>Public programs</h3>

      <p>Libertarians support the end of welfare and other programs that
        drain the national and local budget. It would be in a periodic fashion
        for about 5 years. Why? Most program for example SNAP are not achieving
        their intended goal and instead are having negative effects including,
        corruption, malpractice, and bottle necking.

      <h2>Libertarain Core beliefs</h2>

      <h3>Indivdual choice</h3>

      <p>What Many libertarians and I support is absolute freemdom.
        we believe that the rights of indivdual people are most important.
        Libertarians have the thought of the people and their welfare in
        every decisiton we make. We believe that individuals are responsible
        for themselves and nothing more. This does not mean colaberation is
        not as important but libertarians agnolage the choice that every
        person needs.</p>

      <h3>Do no harm </h3>

      <p>Many libertarians including myself feel obligated to do no harm at
        consiquense. We do not condone any action that leads or causes to the
        intentional harm of another individual. That is why we created the nap
        to keep others and ourselves in check. </p>

      <h3>Free markets</h3>

      <p>Libertarians reconize the importance of a centralized power but stress
        the need of free interation. A great portion of what libertarins strive
        for is people selling,producing,trading and living without government being
        in every part of their lives. We dont hold grudges or bottle neck our
        competition out of the spot light. Thats the power of the indivdual. </p>
