<h3>Politics</h3>

<p>As many probably know I am highly involved in
politics. So this inspired me to spread the word,
my ideology and learn the ideologys of others. This
podcast lead me to band others togehter in the name
of change. Some examples of what we talk about with
politics we discuss big issues like immigration,
liscensing,, and much more.</p>

<h3>Abstract thought</h3>

<p>On my podcast we talk about anything that comes to
mind. For example, we thought about the ammense influence
technology has had on society so we made a three part
podcast on the impact of technology. Everything from the
wheel to automation and its possiblities. The topic possibilities
are endless.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Ever since my first history class in grade school I have
been intreged with the outcome of history and its effects on
the future. I often think throught histories situations and
what could have been accomplished.</p>

<h3>Hypotheticals</h3>

<p>On the podcast we often like to humor the possiblites if
that is realistic or just a fantasy. For example we talked
about interdimensional aliens and we talked about if the 15
minimum was actually enacted.</p>
