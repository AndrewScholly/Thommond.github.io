    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>I have quite a bit of hobbies but if I had to tone it down to
      three I would choose Cycling, non-fiction reading and the great out
      doors.</p>

      <h3>Cycling</h3>
      <img src="../images/Staunton-Bicycling.jpg" class="hobby" alt="">
      <p>I am a big fan of taking a break during the week to go on
        a long brisk bike ride. I like the workout and that feeling of
        accoplishment at the end of the ride. Most importantly no matter
        how busy my life or my fellow riders lives are we still make it
        to our weekly rides. It brings us together! </p>

      <h3>Non-Fiction Reading</h3>
      <img src="../images/image-for-non-fiction-books.jpg" class="hobby" alt="">
      <p>I due enjoy lots of generas of books but my favorite by far
        is Non-fiction. I enjoy non-fiction reading the most due to the
        satifaction I get from learing and using something new. Non-
        fiction lets the reader carry the facts however they please,me
        personally I make a story about the information instead of the
        author doing it for me!</p>

      <h3>The Great Outdoors</h3>
      <img src="../images/Great-Smoke.jpg" class="hobby" alt="">
      <p>There is so much to love about nature but to keep this small I
        will be brief. When I feel stressed or just want some leisure time
        I will get outside. Ever since I was a small boy the sight of trees
        or the sound of the animals would give me joy. After all who doesnt
        love nature?</p>

 <h3>Story's if you are curious</h3>

<h4>Career change</h4>

<p>I always wanted to be a welder. I spent my highschool career
taking shop classes and information extracuriculars about the
trade. I had a  half day ctc program where I welded for 4 hours
a day. The work was diffucult to say the least. 3500+ degree flames
and 100+ degree heat every day. However I enjoyed my work creating
grills, tables,small building frames and even motercylces. But What
made me reconsider my welding career was the enviorment not the
work. Then, my junior year I decieded I wanted a change of scenery
so I got into web development. Ever since I discovered web dev I
have been on a  mission to improve my skills and change rapidly.</p>

<h4>Business?</h4>

<p>Ever since I was very young I had a ambition to sell and
create. I made a binder I called it my Idea binder. I planned
trips, inventions, collaberation techniques and small businesses.
For example, I started a cookie business in school, I "hired" a
couple of my friends to sell all types of cookies that I baked from
stratch. It was quite successful, we made about 300 a month. When
you are in middle school thats a lot of money. We even expanded
to candy and drinks. However we were stoped by the principle due
to we were not allowed to sell unless is was through the school. I
never stopped trying recycleing businesses, yard sale resale, and
3D printed wire holders. I am not stopping now either.</p>

<h4>Hard work is key</h4>

<p>What I have noticed in my short life time is you will not
move up in society unless you work hard. That may seem obvious
but realistly many spend thier days unproductivly and expect
results or complain about the results they recieve. I have no
problem if you are comfortable where you are but for those who
have a dream of their success but dont but in the work, they are
lying to themselves. Continuing the same behaviour over and over
but expecting a different result is called insanity. Work,achive,
fail,succed this is the process. </p>

<h4>Busy</h4>

<p>The world is always moving with or without you. As a society
we embrase information at ever turn. Social media, radio, television
web surfing, and much more. We are always occupied, always on the
move but is it healthy? Thats a question for yourself to answer
truley but I think not. There is no problem with the sharing of
information however being occupied with every possible task may
be to much for some to handle. What do we do about it? The internet
and the vertial world is not going away if anything it will be more
involed later down the road. However, it is an indivdual choice to
"unplug" from time to time. Take a walk, play a sport, even just
put your electronics down and read a book. Who knows you may enjoy
a the break? </p>

<h4>Appreciation</h4>

<p>We learn durning our lives to take the moment in and savor the
good times. As children we observe and absorb the world around us.
As teenagers we learn the ropes and want to experiment without a
care in the world. The ansty teen who want to be alone but does not
fully understand the magnitude of true responsiblity and acts like they
do. Young adults, finally independent but always confused about their
future. Then, the company. After the slow learning process of responsibl
ity (which never ends), we take on new leaps of our life like a family,
stable job and new adventures. Then, the routine of life settles in
we get in the flow of work, family, relax and repeat. It may sound
daunting but its quite the opposite. During every phase we learn and we
live. Life is mysterious but never get discouraged becuase their is
always a future, their is always reason for apperciation.</p>
