<h2>Want details? Below I explain in deep deatial the polices and core beliefs of libertarians</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Lets start with Polices</h3>

<h4>The N.A.P</h4>

<p>I full support the N.A.P. which stands for  the Non-Aggression principle.
What this means is anyone who shows acts of aggrssion towards others may violate
the N.A.P. This does not mean just if you get angry, this means anyone who puts
merit behide their aggression.For example, Assault, theft, violation of contract, etc.
Want to know a bit more? Here is a<a href="#">Wikapidia</a> page about the N.A.P.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Gun policy</h4>

<p>Libertarians including myself support the 2nd amendment in its entirety.
I support americans right to defend themselves no matter the circumstances.
No gun bans, no gun restrictions, no gun regulations, no gun attachment bans
and finally no bullshit. I take our rights very seriously.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Drug policy</h4>

<p>Many libertarians such as myself support decriminalization of all drugs
and the legalization of cannabis as well as Psycoactive mushrooms. I support
this because in all reality no matter if a substance is illegal those who
want it will do it anyway. For example the prohibition of alchohol in the <time>1920s</time>.
My point is prohibiton of any substance does not work.</p>
