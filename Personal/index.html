          <h2>Where I stand</h2>

          <p>I consider myself a Agorist - Libertarian.If you dont know what<br><!--Make Agorist and Libertarian link to the wikapida page about them-->
            is not to worry read up on it or read a brief summary from me.<br>
          Agorism- The belief that as long as actions are done with consent and<br>
          are voluntary to all parties affected then it is legal. Libertarianism<br>
          is a bit more complicated so for that one read up the topic on Wikapidia<br>
           </p>
                <hr>
           <p>For the record I am supportive of many conservative polices but when it <br>
           comes down to it libertarians support the strongest individual rights. Unlike<br>
         the democrats or republicans , libertarians support gun rights, LGBTQ+ rights, <br>
           deregulation, the slash of our budget, ingesting what ever you want and of course<br>
           life, liberty and the pursuee of happyness.</p>

          <p>To show you in more detail, here is a list.</p>

          <ul>

            <li>I consider myself a pro-life individual</li>
            <li>I am for open borders</li>
            <li>I support heavy deregulation of the free market</li>
            <li>I support LGBTQ+ rights but they will not be government funded</li>
            <li>I do not support government action on climate change</li>
            <li>I do not support our current military policy or spending</li>
            <li>I am supportive of legization of Cannabis, Psycoactive<br>
            mushrooms and the decrimilzation of all drugs</li>
            <li>I am against any infringment of the constitution</li>
            <li>Most importantly I support the people over power</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>Current Government polices</h2>

          <p>What I take rather seriously is the spending problem congress<br>
          and most government offices possess. I am fully against unessary <br>
          spending. What is unessary? I support dramaticly cutting our foriegn<br>
          aid, welfare, social security, medicare/medicad, and military spending.<br>
          A saying I live by is what ever the government can do the free market<br>
          can do it better.</p>

          <p>Just to make a note I would like to tell my supporters that I do <br>
          not take the violation of the privacy of americans very well. I do not<br>
          support red flag laws, TSA, the Patriot Act, warrentless searches/seiz<br>
          ures and last but not least the collection of meta data.  </p>
