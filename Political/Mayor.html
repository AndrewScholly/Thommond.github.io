    <h2>My mission</h2>

    <p>I want to help society forward. I want to see my
    change in the making. I want to run for mayor. Unlike
    most jobs you can have an impact on everyone in society
    directly. I want to run for mayor to spread the belief of
    liberty, freedom, and the pursue of happness. If I every
    have the prevlidge to be a mayor I hope to give people insperation
    about the future and let others decied their path.</p>

    <h3>Why Mayor?</h3>

    <p>I know that the responsibility of congress and governer may
    overwhelm me for my first public service. I want to effect a
    small group of people so I can focus on their problems to make
    life easier for them. I can solve the problems the few which is
    just as important as serving the needs of the many. When you are
    mayor people thank you face to face or tell you their struggles
    and you can truly connect.</p>

    <h3>Why me?</h3>

    <p>Why am I worthy of being a mayor? I cant say I am the best or
      that I am the one to change the town better than ever before.
      However, That is my goal. I want to stick up for the indivdual
      and support the people at ever possible every turn. Together
      is how we change for the better. </p>
